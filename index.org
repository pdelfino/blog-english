I try to [[http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html][keep my identity small]]. I dislike social media, but I love the social aspect of the web. I also enjoy building things and writing about them. Here you'll find stuff that interested me. If you want to chat about any of it, see the [[*Contact][contact section]] below.
