I miss you. I mean, the _old_ you.
I don’t really miss _you_.
What I miss the most is believing in you, love.

I used to believe in love: real, stable, loyal, perennial, honest,
reliable eternal love. The kind that grows old and turns grey
together.

But you died.
May you… rest in peace?

Good luck... for me.
What about you?
For you?
What?

Haikai (俳諧)!

For You..
