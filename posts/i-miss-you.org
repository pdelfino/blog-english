I miss you. I mean, the old you.
I don’t miss you.
What I miss the most is believing in you, love.

I used to believe in love:
real, stable, loyal, perennial, eternal love.
The kind that grows old and turns grey together.

But you died.
May you… rest in peace?

Good luck... for me.
What about you?
For you?
What?

Haikai (俳諧)!

For You..
