My first vinyl painting was an attempt to mimic Katsushika Hokusai's
The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1831). However, it was absolutely
horrible.

Thankfully, unlike a normal canvas, vinyl is a blessing because you
can flip it over and try again. Lucas kindly went to the workshop with
me. Without him, my work would have been even worse. Thanks for coming,
bro!

Even though my first attempt was a "fake wave" (ba-dumtss), the second
turned into hipster geometry. And it still vibed with my bedroom
decoration.

Since I love (and miss) surfing, a few weeks ago I bought a nice surfboard
for decoration, a good trigger for memories of an awesome trip to
Los Angeles last summer. By the way, thanks for hosting me, Fiedler.
Man, I really do have great friends!

Now my room looks badass with both purchased and self-made decorations.
I actually tried swapping my piece with a cutie who had also painted a
wave. Her wave was formidable, just like her eyes. Unfortunately, she
refused my offer to exchange our works.

She says she is decisive. But I am persistent. As Vito Corleone said,
"I will make her an offer she cannot refuse." Viva l'Italia.
